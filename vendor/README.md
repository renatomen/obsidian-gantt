DHTMLX Gantt (Standard Edition, GPLv2) offline assets

Place the following files here to run the plugin fully offline:

- vendor/dhtmlx/dhtmlxgantt.js (or dhtmlxgantt.min.js)
- vendor/dhtmlx/dhtmlxgantt.css (or dhtmlxgantt.min.css)

Notes
- The plugin is GPLv2; bundling DHTMLX Standard Edition is license-compatible.
- Do NOT include PRO/commercial assets in public distribution unless you hold a license (and do not commit them).
- The build copies vendor/ into dist/vendor and the installer copies dist/vendor to the vault plugin folder.
