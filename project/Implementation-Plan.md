### 3. Foundation Infrastructure (OG-9) - **PRIORITY: HIGH**
**Status**: Core Implementation
**Timeline**: Week 2-3
**Dependencies**: Development Infrastructure, BDD Testing Framework

**Goals**:
- Svelte 5 component architecture with runes
- SVAR Gantt chart integration
- Mobile-responsive design
- Basic Obsidian view registration

**Key Stories**:
- OG-21: As a user, I want to see a basic Gantt chart in Obsidian so that I can visualize my tasks
- OG-22: As a user, I want the plugin to work on mobile devices so that I can access it anywhere

### 4. Bases Data Integration (OG-10) - **PRIORITY: HIGH**
**Status**: Primary Data Source
**Timeline**: Week 3-4
**Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure

**Goals**:
- Bases view type registration and integration
- Flexible field mapping system
- Virtual task management for multi-parent relationships
- Reactive data pipeline

**Key Stories**:
- OG-23: As a user, I want to create Gantt charts from my Bases data so that I can visualize my structured notes
- OG-24: As a user, I want to configure which properties appear as columns so that I can customize my view

### 5. Task Management (OG-11) - **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**
**Status**: User Interactions
**Timeline**: Week 4-5
**Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure, Bases Data Integration

**Goals**:
- Direct task editing in Gantt view
- Task creation from Gantt interface
- Data validation and consistency
- Bi-directional sync with Obsidian notes

### 6. Configuration Management (OG-12) - **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**
**Status**: User Customization
**Timeline**: Week 5-6
**Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure

**Goals**:
- Flexible field mapping configuration
- Persistent view preferences
- Display customization options
- User-defined property schemas

### 7. Dataview Integration (OG-13) - **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Secondary Data Source
**Timeline**: Week 6-7
**Dependencies**: Foundation Infrastructure

**Goals**:
- DQL query support for Gantt data
- DataviewJS integration for complex processing
- Code block processor for obsidian-gantt blocks
- Consistent interface across data sources

### 8. Performance & Polish (OG-14) - **PRIORITY: LOW**
**Status**: Optimization and Finalization
**Timeline**: Week 7-8
**Dependencies**: All previous epics

**Goals**:
- Virtual scrolling and performance optimization
- Accessibility enhancements (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Documentation and usage examples

## BDD Requirements

### Executable Specifications
Every Story must have corresponding BDD scenarios that serve as:
- Official requirements documentation
- Automated acceptance tests
- Living documentation that stays current

```

### BDD Scenario Standards
- Use Given-When-Then structure
- Write in domain language (avoid technical implementation details)
- Focus on user behavior and outcomes
- Ensure scenarios are independent and can run in isolation
- Include concrete examples with realistic data

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
git checkout -b OG-123-descriptive-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Format
```bash
git commit -m "OG-123 Implement user authentication flow"
```

### Pull Request Requirements
- Include work item key in PR title: "OG-123 Add responsive design for mobile"
- Link to corresponding Jira work item
- Ensure all BDD scenarios pass
- Include test coverage for new functionality

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write BDD scenarios first (executable specifications)
2. Write failing unit tests
3. Implement minimum code to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green
5. Ensure E2E scenarios pass

### Testing Levels
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with Obsidian API mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Component integration with real data
- **E2E Tests**: WebdriverIO with wdio-obsidian-service
- **BDD Scenarios**: Cucumber integration for all user stories

### Quality Gates
- 80%+ code coverage
- All linting and type checking passes
- All BDD scenarios pass
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility standards compliance

## Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence
- Build time < 10 seconds
- Test execution < 30 seconds
- Plugin load time < 2 seconds
- Memory usage < 50MB for 1000 tasks

### User Experience
- Mobile responsiveness across devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Intuitive configuration interface
- Comprehensive error handling

### Development Efficiency
- Hot reload development workflow
- Automated quality enforcement
- Living documentation accuracy
- CI/CD pipeline reliability

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Begin OG-7 (Development Infrastructure Setup)
   - Set up local development environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

2. **Week 1 Goals**:
   - Complete development infrastructure
