# Implementation Plan: SVAR Obsidian Gantt Plugin

**Project**: obsidian-gantt — React-based Gantt chart visualization using SVAR React Gantt
**Status**: Phase 2 in progress — Dynamic columns and integration tests completed; next up: column visibility+ordering synced to Bases settings, missing-date indicators UX, and type hygiene
**Created**: 2025-01-22
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-23

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step development of a modern, React-based Gantt chart plugin that leverages SVAR React Gantt's multi-instance architecture to replace the existing DHTMLX-based solution.

## Architecture Foundation

### Core Principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: SVAR actions + custom Obsidian events
- **Multi-Datasource Support**: Pluggable data sources (Bases, Dataview, future)
- **Reusable Components**: Data-source agnostic core components
- **Flexible Field Mapping**: Runtime configuration, minimal requirements
- **Mobile-First**: Cross-platform support with touch interactions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Gantt Library**: SVAR React Gantt (wx-react-gantt)
- **Build System**: esbuild with TypeScript compilation
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Obsidian Integration**: obsidian-typings (Phase 1), official Bases API (Phase 2)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **SVAR React Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with minimal integration, iterate incrementally
   - Fallback: Comprehensive documentation review and community support

2. **Obsidian Bases API Changes**
   - Mitigation: Use obsidian-typings initially, plan migration to official API
   - Fallback: Maintain compatibility layer for API transitions

3. **Mobile Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Early mobile testing, progressive optimization
   - Fallback: Simplified mobile UI with reduced feature set

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict milestone adherence, MVP-first approach
   - Fallback: Defer non-essential features to future releases

2. **Timeline Delays**
   - Mitigation: Buffer time in estimates, parallel development where possible
   - Fallback: Prioritize core functionality over polish features

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Multi-instance support: 5+ simultaneous views without conflicts
- [ ] Performance: <2s rendering for 1000 tasks on desktop
- [ ] Mobile compatibility: Functional on iOS/Android with touch support
- [ ] Field mapping flexibility: Any user property names supported
- [ ] Error rate: <1% of user interactions result in errors

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Configuration simplicity: Only id/text fields required for basic setup
- [ ] Property naming freedom: Users can use any property names
- [ ] Dynamic columns: Automatic generation from Bases property selection
