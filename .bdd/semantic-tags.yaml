# Validation rules for tag usage
validation:
  required_tags:
    - "epic"  # Every scenario must have an epic tag
    - "priority"  # Every scenario must have a priority
  
  mutually_exclusive:
    - ["@smoke", "@integration"]  # Smoke tests should be fast, not integration
    - ["@priority-critical", "@priority-low"]  # Can't be both critical and low
  
  recommended_combinations:
    - ["@smoke", "@priority-critical"]  # Smoke tests are usually critical
    - ["@performance", "@priority-high"]  # Performance tests are important
    - ["@accessibility", "@component-ui"]  # Accessibility relates to UI

# Tag usage guidelines
guidelines:
  epic_tags:
    - "Use exactly one epic tag per scenario"
    - "Epic tags represent major feature areas"
    - "Choose the most relevant epic for the scenario"
  
  feature_tags:
    - "Use one or more feature tags as appropriate"
    - "Feature tags should align with the chosen epic"
    - "Be specific about the functionality being tested"
  
  priority_tags:
    - "Use exactly one priority tag per scenario"
    - "Consider business impact and technical risk"
    - "Critical scenarios block releases"
  
  test_type_tags:
    - "Use one or more test type tags"
    - "Consider execution time and frequency"
    - "Smoke tests should be fast and reliable"
